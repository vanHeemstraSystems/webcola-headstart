Using cola.js in cytoscape.js

Cytoscape.js has full support for Cola.js via an extension. 

Cytoscape.js has a full graph theory model, highly customisable styling, gesture support, and layouts — such that Cola.js can be run in Cytoscape.js in a single line of code:

```
cy.layout({ name: 'cola' /* and maybe some other options */ });
```
